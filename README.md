# Object-Detection
Run one of the most popular object detection algorithms YOLO v3. using the live feed of webcam,
The method used is the most easiest as it does not require any external installation.
i used the yolov3-320 configurations and weights 
you can use the tiny configuration and weights for faster recognition but less confidence with the detection
